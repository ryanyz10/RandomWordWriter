Hop! Hop! I am a Yop. All I like to do is hop from finger top to finger top. I hop from left to right and then... Hop! Hop! I hop right back again. I like to hop all day and night from right to left and left to right. Why do I like to hop, hop, hop? I do not know. Go ask your Pop. Brush! Brush! Brush! Brush! Comb! Comb! Comb! Comb! Blue hair is fun to brush and comb. All girls who like to brush and comb should have a pet like this at home. Who is this pet? Say! He is wet. You never yet met a pet, I bet, as wet as they let this wet pet get. Did you ever fly a kite in bed? Did you ever walk with ten cats on your head? Did you ever milk this kind of cow? Well, we can do it. We know how. If you never did, you should. These things are fun and fun is good. Hello! Hello! Are you there? Hello! I called you up to say hello. I said hello.

When I wish to make a wish I wave my hand with a big swish swish. Then I say, "I wish for fish!" And I get fish right on my dish. So... if you wish to wish a wish, you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish. Look what we found in the park in the dark. We will take him home. We will call him Clark. He will live at our house. He will grow and grow. Will our mother like this? We don't know. And now good night. It is time to sleep. So we will sleep with our pet Zeep. Today is gone. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one. Every day, from here to there, funny things are everywhere. These yellow pets are called the Zeds. They have one hair up on their heads.
